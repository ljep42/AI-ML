# AI-ML
These are all my files related to Artifical Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Science. Some are neural networks from scratch and others use the [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library.

NOTE: I'm just beginning learning all the tools and analytical methods so much of it is just practice. Newer files should be more in depth.
